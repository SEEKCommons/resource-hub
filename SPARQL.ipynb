    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to show how to explore the [Wikidata knowledge graph](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) using an [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) query language called [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL).\n",

    "You can run (Try it!) SPARQL queries directly via the [Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org/), but to document your journey, or develop a case study, Jupyter Notebooks might be a more familiar format for many users. This notebook shows you how to get started. **Note:** The Wikidata Query Service can generate code examples in Python and many other host languages, but it is perhaps a little less intuitive than what's described below.\n",

However, there's a fundamental difference between the two queries: without the `LIMIT` keyword, the query returns all (thousands!) cities, and we reduce the number by peeking at the head of the dataframe. With the `LIMIT` keyword, we retrieve only up to five results that are then loaded into the dataframe. The reduction happens on the server side, which is much more efficient, especially if we don't know how many results to expect."

For one, you can have a conversation with your favorite chatbot. If writing queries is not yet your thing, check out the [Wikidata Query Builder](https://query.wikidata.org/querybuilder/?uselang=en). To get a sense of what's possible in SPARQL and as a great source for inspiration, don't miss the [Wikidata:SPARQL query service/queries/examples](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples/en).
