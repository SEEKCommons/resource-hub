    "\n",
    "At its core, the Resource Hub is a *[knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph)* curated by the __[SEEKCommons Project](https://seekcommons.org/)__ that connects the various resources and entities related to the SEEKCommons Project. The graph is built using the [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) knowledge base and is accessible via the [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) query language.\n",

    "The graph is centered around the concept of a *resource*. A resource can be anything from a researcher, a research organization, a software tool, a dataset or a publication. Each resource is connected to other resources through various relationships. For example, a publication can be connected to a researcher who created it, a project that funded it, a publication that used it, or a software tool that processed it.\n",

This can be through the creation of new knowledge, the dissemination of existing knowledge, or the application of knowledge to solve problems.
