# Functional Requirements

These should be described by *future users* of the Resource Hub


From Lane Rasberry of the Resource Hub team:

My imagining for a Resource Hub is that it is a database of research resources. The data in this database should include identifiers for researchers, the research resources they have created, themes or keywords which describe those resources, the institutional affiliations of both the researchers and the resources, and sponsor. The function of the database is that when given user input of any of those fields, output the other ones from the dataset. For example, input of a researcher will output their institution, the list of their resources, some keyword labels on their resources, and so on. Users can input any field in the graph, and get output of a profile for that class of item, including individual researcher profiles, resource profiles, institutional profiles, and topical profiles.

As an example, consider this topical profile of "environmental justice".

The profile lists papers on the topic, identifies researchers frequently publishing on the topic, and lists research resources which papers mention using for this research.

Functional requirements are specific attributes, capabilities, or tasks that a system or product must be able to perform. These requirements are defined during the software development process to guide the design and development of the system. They are directly related to the actions and behaviors of the system when it is in use. Here are some key characteristics of functional requirements:

1. **Specific Functions or Tasks**: They describe what the system should do, such as processing data, executing calculations, or displaying information.

2. **User Interactions**: These requirements outline how the user will interact with the system to perform certain tasks.

3. **Data Management**: They include how data is handled, stored, and retrieved by the system.

4. **Performance Requirements**: These specify the levels of performance the system must achieve, such as response time, throughput, and capacity.

5. **Business Rules and Logic**: Functional requirements define the business logic that guides how the system processes data and makes decisions.

6. **Compliance and Standards**: They ensure that the system adheres to relevant laws, regulations, or industry standards.

7. **Security Features**: This includes authentication, authorization, data encryption, and other security measures.

In software development, functional requirements are often contrasted with non-functional requirements, which focus on the system's operation rather than specific behaviors (e.g., reliability, scalability, usability, etc.). It's crucial for functional requirements to be clear, detailed, and testable to ensure they are implemented correctly in the final product.
