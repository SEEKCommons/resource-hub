# Functional Requirements

These should be described by *future users* of the Resource Hub


ChatGPT says:

Functional requirements are specific attributes, capabilities, or tasks that a system or product must be able to perform. These requirements are defined during the software development process to guide the design and development of the system. They are directly related to the actions and behaviors of the system when it is in use. Here are some key characteristics of functional requirements:

1. **Specific Functions or Tasks**: They describe what the system should do, such as processing data, executing calculations, or displaying information.

2. **User Interactions**: These requirements outline how the user will interact with the system to perform certain tasks.

3. **Data Management**: They include how data is handled, stored, and retrieved by the system.

4. **Performance Requirements**: These specify the levels of performance the system must achieve, such as response time, throughput, and capacity.

5. **Business Rules and Logic**: Functional requirements define the business logic that guides how the system processes data and makes decisions.

6. **Compliance and Standards**: They ensure that the system adheres to relevant laws, regulations, or industry standards.

7. **Security Features**: This includes authentication, authorization, data encryption, and other security measures.

In software development, functional requirements are often contrasted with non-functional requirements, which focus on the system's operation rather than specific behaviors (e.g., reliability, scalability, usability, etc.). It's crucial for functional requirements to be clear, detailed, and testable to ensure they are implemented correctly in the final product.
