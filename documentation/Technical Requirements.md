# Technical Requirements

These should be defined by the RH gang, based on functional requirements.

From Lane of the Resource Hub gang:

The Resource Hub has the following components of note:
1. a database platform, with Wikidata being the default
2. a dataset, with WikiCite being the default data environment but also requiring an additional socio-environmental justice dataset specific to this project
3. a frontend, with Scholia being the default but our own SEEKCommons Jupyter notebooks being a more adaptable, controllable, archivable alternative
4. an accessibility plan, with the Wikimedia environment being the default as it includes cultural norms for web-based accessibility, civility, diversity, usability, new-user onboarding, and some usage statistics
5. documentation and reporting, with existing Scholia reports being the default documentation pending our presentation of SEEKCommons as a case study

In summary, the default plan for the Resource Hub is to build it integrated in Wikipedia's own platform, and inheriting Wikipedia's default system characteristics including everything ChatGPT listed below unless the SEEKCommons team chooses to change something. The most significant intervention which SEEKCommons has planned is the addition of the field-specific dataset.

Technical requirements, also known as system requirements, are the technical aspects that a system must fulfill to meet its functional requirements. They define the technical conditions and constraints under which a system must operate. These requirements are crucial in guiding the design and development of a system, particularly in the fields of software development, engineering, and IT systems. Key aspects of technical requirements include:

1. **Hardware Specifications**: This includes details about the necessary hardware components like processors, memory, storage, network interfaces, and other physical components.

2. **Software Specifications**: These requirements outline the operating systems, middleware, databases, and other software components the system must be compatible with or utilize.

3. **System Integrations**: Technical requirements specify how the system will integrate with other existing systems, including APIs, data exchanges, and communication protocols.

4. **Performance Criteria**: This covers the system's expected performance levels, such as processing speed, response time, throughput, capacity, and efficiency.

5. **Security Specifications**: They include requirements for data encryption, secure data storage, access controls, and other cybersecurity measures.

6. **Scalability and Reliability**: Details on how the system should scale with increased use or data and how it maintains reliability under various conditions.

7. **Compliance and Standards**: Requirements for compliance with industry standards, regulations, and laws relevant to the technical aspects of the system.

8. **Quality Attributes**: These may include usability, maintainability, and portability considerations.

9. **Environmental Conditions**: For some systems, this includes operating temperature ranges, humidity levels, exposure to elements, and other physical environmental factors.

10. **Backup and Recovery**: Specifications for data backup, disaster recovery processes, and system redundancy.

Technical requirements are essential for ensuring that a system is built on a robust, reliable, and suitable technological foundation. They are typically more detailed and technical than functional requirements and are crucial for system architects, developers, and engineers during the system design and implementation phases.
