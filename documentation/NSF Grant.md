# NSF Grant

An NSF grant or award is conferred by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q304878). The SEEKCommons Wikidata entity schema can be found here: [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/EntitySchema:E455](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/EntitySchema:E455).

The salient features of a grant are:
- An NSF award ID
- A title
- One or more main subjects
- Start and end times (dates)
- A budget
- One or more principal (co-)investigators
- An official website
- Example: [Disciplinary Improvements: The SEEKCommons Research Coordination Network](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q118147233)

## Considerations

A grant or award is not a project; however, it typically funds one or more projects.

Many publications are funded/supported by grants.
